# Vue.js Study - Meal App

This repository contains a simple Vue.js application that I built while learning the Vue.js frontend development framework. The app serves as a practical exercise to understand key Vue.js concepts such as components, data binding, and routing.

## Features

- **Component-based Architecture:** The app follows a modular structure, with each feature encapsulated within its own Vue component.
- **Data Binding:** Utilizes Vue's reactive data binding to update the UI dynamically based on user interactions.
- **Routing:** Implements Vue Router for client-side routing, allowing seamless navigation between different views.
- **Styling:** Uses Tailwind for styling components.
